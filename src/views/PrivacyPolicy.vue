        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Effective Date
            <br /><br />May 24, 2024

            <br /><br /><span class="bold">1. ABOUT</span>

            <br /><br />Bunt, Inc. and its affiliates’ (“Bunt,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) goal is to make design accessible
            to all.
            This Privacy Policy will help you understand how we collect, use and share your personal information and
            assist you in exercising the privacy rights available to you.

            <br /><br />Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings set forth in our Terms of
            Service.
            <br /><br /><span class="bold">2. SCOPE</span>

            <br /><br />This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by us, including on our websites
            (e.g.,
            Bunt.com, designsystems.com and any other websites that we own or operate), our mobile applications, our
            application program interfaces, our design tool services, and our related online and offline offerings
            (collectively, the “Services”).

            <br /><br />This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even
            if they are
            accessible through our Services. In addition, a separate privacy notice, available upon request if it
            applies to you, governs processing relating to our current employees and contractors.
            <br /><br /><span class="bold">3. PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</span>

            <br /><br />The personal information we collect depends on how you interact with our Services.
            Information You Provide to Us

            <br /><br />Candidate Information. We may post job openings and opportunities on the Services. If you reply
            to one of
            these postings or otherwise provide us with your candidacy information, we will collect and process the
            information you provide to us.

            <br /><br />Service Use Information. We collect information you provide to the Services for the purpose of
            providing the
            Services to you, which may include personal information such as information about your interactions with
            other users and any content you create or upload when using the Services, which can include your voice if
            you use any Bunt voice features.

            <br /><br />Customer Service Information (including Training and Quality Assurance). If you call or
            otherwise interact
            with Bunt’s sales, customer service or support personnel, we collect the information you provide to our
            representatives. In addition, we may record telephone calls or video conferences between you and our
            representatives for training or quality assurance purposes.

            <br /><br />Automatic Data Collection. We collect certain information automatically when you use the
            Services. This
            information may include your Internet protocol (IP) address, user settings, cookie identifiers,
            mobile advertising and other unique identifiers, details about your browser, operating system or device,
            location information (inferred from your IP address), internet service provider, pages that you visit
            before, during and after using the Services, information about the links you click, and information about
            how you interact with and use the Services.

            <br /><br />With your permission, we may also collect information about your operating system’s installed
            fonts in
            connection with providing the Services to you.

            <br /><br />Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, and Analytics Information. We, as well as third parties that
            may provide
            content, advertising, or other functionality on or in connection with the Services, may use cookies, pixel
            tags, local storage, and other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically collect information through
            the Services. Technologies are essentially small data files placed on your device that allow us and our
            partners to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Services.

            <br /><br />Cookies. Cookies are small text files placed in device browsers to store their preferences. For
            more
            information about how to control what data are collected by cookies, see below in the “Your Choices”
            section.
            Pixel Tags/Web Beacons. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in the Services
            that collects information about engagement on the Services. The use of a pixel tag allows us to record, for
            example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also
            include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.

            <br /><br />Third Party Services and Organizations. We may obtain information about you from other sources,
            including
            from third party services and organizations. For example, if you access our Services through a third-party
            service, we may collect information about you from that third-party service that you have made available via
            your privacy settings.

            <br /><br /><span class="bold">4. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION AND OUR LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING</span>

            <br /><br />In this section we describe all the ways we use your personal data, and the legal bases we rely
            on to do so.

            <br /><br />In certain situations, we require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which is
            reasonable
            for you to expect as part of running our business and which does not materially affect your rights and
            freedoms. We have identified below what our legitimate interests are.

            <br /><br />When we process your information based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your
            consent at any
            time without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on such consent before it is withdrawn. To
            exercise your rights, see the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy.

            <br /><br />Legal Basis: Necessary for our legitimate interests (to use personal information to create
            de-identified
            and/or aggregated information, such as de-identified demographic information, de-identified location
            information, and information about the device from which you access our Services. De-identified and/or
            aggregated information is used for several purposes, including research, industry analysis, analytics, and
            any other legally permissible purposes.)

            <br /><br /><span class="bold">5. DISCLOSING YOUR INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES</span>

            <br /><br /> We may share any personal information we collect with the following categories of third
            parties:

            <br /><br /> Other Users of Bunt’s Services. When you use the Services to collaborate or interact with
            others (including
            viewing files of other users), we will share certain information with your collaborators. For example, you
            can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant permission to others to see, share,
            edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your administrator (if applicable) select. In
            addition, some of the collaboration features of the Services display some or all of your information to
            other Service users when you share or interact with specific content. For example, when you comment, we
            display your profile picture and name next to your comments so that other users with access to the comment
            know who made it. Similarly, when you join a team, your name, profile picture and contact information will
            be displayed in a list for other team members so they can find and interact with you. Finally, when you
            interact with a user’s file, information about your interaction, including your IP address and the actions
            you’ve taken in connection with the file, may be made available to the file’s administrator. Please note
            that while we require all our users to comply with our acceptable use policy, we are not responsible for
            privacy practices of users who receive information about you through the Services.

            <br /><br /> The Public. Content can be made publicly available by you or others collaborating on it, and in
            such cases
            any information about you included in such content is also publicly available and can be indexed by search
            engines. You can check at any time whether particular content is public or private by viewing the content’s
            settings. In addition, in connection with your posting of content on Bunt Community, we will publicly share
            your picture, name, user handle, and Twitter (or other social networking site) handle (to the extent you
            have provided us with this information).

            <br /><br /> Third-Party Platforms and Services. We will share your personal information with third-party
            platforms
            and/or services if you have expressly consented or requested that we do so. Please note we do not endorse,
            screen or approve, and are not responsible for, the practices or conduct of such third-party services.

            <br /><br />Disclosures to Protect Us or Others. We will access, preserve, and disclose information we have
            associated
            with you to competent law enforcement bodies, regulatory and government agencies, courts or other third
            parties if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (i) comply with law enforcement or national
            security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (ii) protect your, our or others’
            rights, property, or safety; (iii) enforce Bunt’s policies and contracts; (iv) collect amounts owed to us;
            (v) prevent financial loss or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual
            illegal activity; or (vi) if we, in good faith, believe that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable.

            <br /><br /> Disclosure in the Event of Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfer. If we are involved in a
            merger,
            acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, purchase or sale of assets,
            or transition of service to another provider, then your information may be sold or transferred in accordance
            with our legitimate interests in administering our business as part of such a transaction, as permitted by
            law and/or contract.

            <br /><br /><span class="bold">7. E.U. – Libya PRIVACY SHIELD – Libya PRIVACY SHIELD</span>

            <br /><br /> Bunt relies on Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of personal data. In addition,
            Bunt continues
            to comply with the E.U. - Libya Privacy Shield Framework - Libya Privacy Shield Framework as set
            forth by the Libya Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal
            information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the Libya.

            <br /><br /> Bunt has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield
            Principles. If there
            is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy
            Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, and to view our
            certification, please visit the Libya Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List.

            <br /><br />Bunt is responsible for onward transfers to our agents under the Privacy Shield Framework. With
            respect to
            personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Bunt is subject to
            the regulatory enforcement powers of the Libya Federal Trade Commission.

            <br /><br />If you have any questions or concerns related to our Privacy Shield certification or to resolve
            any
            complaints about our collection or use of your personal information, you should first contact us using the
            information set forth below.

            <br /><br />Bunt has further committed to refer unresolved complaints related to personal information to
            JAMS Privacy
            Shield Dispute Resolution Program, an independent dispute resolution provider located in the Libya
            made available free of charge.

            <br /><br />Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may be
            entitled to invoke
            binding arbitration when other dispute resolution options do not satisfactorily resolve your concerns.

            <br /><br /><span class="bold">8. YOUR CHOICES</span>

            <br /><br />General. You have the right to opt out of certain uses of your personal information.

            <br /><br />Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising. You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject
            cookies. If
            you are located in the European Union, you can change your cookie preferences through our cookie consent
            tool, which you can access at any time by clicking the “cookie settings” in the footer of our website (you
            may need to log out of your Bunt account to access the footer). You can also stop or restrict the placement
            of Technologies on your device or remove them by adjusting your preferences as your browser or device
            permits. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, you may
            opt out of personalized advertisements on some mobile applications by following the instructions for Android
            and iOS.

            <br /><br />“Do Not Track”. Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web
            browsers. We
            do not respond to DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.

            <br /><br /><span class="bold">9. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS</span>

            <br /><br />In accordance with applicable law, you may have the right to:

            <br /><br />Access Personal Information about you, including: (i) confirming whether we are processing your
            personal
            information; (ii) obtaining access to or a copy of your personal information; and (iii) receiving an
            electronic copy of personal information that you have provided to us, or asking us to send that information
            to another company (the “right of data portability”);
            Request Correction of your personal information where it is inaccurate or incomplete. In some cases, we may
            provide self-service tools that enable you to update your personal information;
            Request Deletion of your personal information;
            Request Restriction of or Object to our processing of your personal information; and
            Withdraw your Consent to our processing of your personal information.
            Opt-out of marketing communications. Please see more on this above.

            <br /><br />If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us.

            <br /><br />We will process such requests in accordance with applicable laws. To protect your privacy, we
            will take
            steps to verify your identity before fulfilling your request.

            <br /><br />Please note that if you use our Services on behalf of an organization (e.g., your employer),
            that
            organization may be responsible for fulfilling the individual rights requests referenced above.

            <br /><br /><span class="bold">10. DATA RETENTION</span>

            <br /><br />We store the personal information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as
            you use our
            Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services, resolve
            disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our
            agreements, and/or comply with applicable laws. The specific retention periods depend on the nature of the
            information and why it is collected and processed and the nature of the legal requirement.

            <br /><br />When we have no ongoing legitimate business need or legal reason to process your personal
            information, we
            will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
            information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and
            isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. You may request deletion of your personal
            information at any time as noted in “Your Privacy Rights”, above, but that will require you to delete your
            account with us, as we need your personal data to maintain your account.

            <br /><br /><span class="bold">11. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</span>

            <br /><br />We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this
            Privacy
            Policy.

            <br /><br />We may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative
            issues relating
            to your use of the Services. If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you
            electronically by posting a notice on the Services, by mail or by sending an email to you.

            <br /><br /><span class="bold">12. THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES/APPLICATIONS</span>

            <br /><br />The Services may contain links to other websites/applications and other websites/applications
            may reference
            or link to our Services. These third-party services are not controlled by us. We encourage our users to read
            the privacy policies of each website and application with which they interact. We do not endorse, screen or
            approve, and are not responsible for, the privacy practices or content of such other websites or
            applications. Visiting these other websites or applications is at your own risk.

            <br /><br /><span class="bold">15. CHILDREN’S INFORMATION</span>

            <br /><br />The Services are not directed to children under 13 (or other age as required by local law), and,
            except for
            limited circumstances set forth below, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If
            you learn that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, you may contact us
            as set forth below. If we learn that we have collected a child’s personal information in violation of
            applicable law, we will promptly take steps to delete such information and terminate the child’s account,
            or, if appropriate and possible, seek written consent from such child’s guardian.

            <br /><br />Although our Services are designed for a general audience, in some cases students in the Libya
            under
            the age of thirteen may use the Services pursuant to an agreement we have with the student’s educational
            institution. For more details regarding our processing of personal information that we collect from
            children.

            <br /><br /><span class="bold">17. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</span>

            <br /><br />We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time at our sole discretion. If there are any
            material
            changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you as required by applicable law.
