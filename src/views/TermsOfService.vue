            <br /><br />
            Welcome to the Bunt, Inc. (“Bunt”, “us” “we” or “our”) website. Please read these Terms of Service (the
            “Terms”) carefully because they govern your use of our websites and our mobile and desktop applications
            (“Apps”), our application program interfaces (“APIs”), our software development kits (“SDKs”) and our
            collaboration tools and other products and services we may later own or operate (collectively, with the
            Sites, Apps, APIs, and SDKs, the “Services”).
            <br /><br />
            ARBITRATION NOTICE: UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE YOU FIRST AGREE TO THESE
            TERMS BY FOLLOWING THE OPT-OUT PROCEDURE SPECIFIED IN THE “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION BELOW, THESE TERMS
            WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU TO SUBMIT CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST US TO BINDING AND FINAL
            ARBITRATION SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS PART OF A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR CONSOLIDATED
            ACTION.
            <br /><br /><span class="bold">1. Agreement to these Terms</span>
            <br /><br />
            By using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you dont agree to these Terms, do not use
            the Services. If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or
            other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other
            legal entity to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that company or other legal
            entity.
            <br /><br /><span class="bold">2. Changes to the Terms or Services</span>

            We may modify the Terms at any time, at our sole discretion. If we do so, we will let you know either by
            posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. If you continue to use the Services
            after such a change, you are indicating that you agree to the modified Terms. We may also change or
            discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice or liability, at our sole
            discretion.
            <br /><br /><span class="bold">3. Service Terms</span>

            <br /><br />3.1. Who may use the Services. You may only use the Services if you are old enough to consent
            (by yourself and not by a parent or guardian) to share your data under applicable law. For example, you must
            be 13 years or older under most Libya’ law, or 16 years or older under California or European Union law.

            <br /><br />3.2. Use Restrictions. Except as otherwise expressly authorized in these Terms, do not, and will
            not encourage or assist third parties to: (i) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt
            to discover the source code, object code, or underlying structure, ideas, know-how, or algorithms relevant
            to the Services (except to the extent that such a restriction is impermissible under applicable law); (ii)
            provide, sell, resell, transfer, sublicense, lend, distribute, rent, or otherwise allow others to access or
            use the Services; (iii) copy, modify, create derivative works of, or remove proprietary notices from the
            Services; or (iv) circumvent any technical limitations implemented by Bunt.

            <br /><br />3.3. Feedback; Use Rights. We welcome feedback, comments, and suggestions (“Feedback”). As we
            need to be able to freely work with your Feedback to improve the Services, you hereby irrevocably transfer
            and assign all right, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights, such as copyrights or
            trade secrets) in and to the Feedback, including any and all “moral rights” that you might have in such
            Feedback, and you hereby forever waive and agree never to assert any and all “moral rights” you may have in
            the Feedback. Additionally, Bunt will have the right to collect and analyze data and other information
            relating to the provision, use, and performance of various aspects of the Services, and related systems and
            technologies, and Bunt will be free (during and after the term) to use such data and information to
            maintain, improve, and enhance any products or services.

            <br /><br /><span class="bold">4. License</span>

            <br /><br />4.1. License to Services. Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, we hereby grant
            you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license worldwide (with the exception of
            (i) jurisdictions that are embargoed or designated as supporting terrorist activities by the Libyan
            Government and (ii) jurisdictions whose laws do not permit engaging in business with Bunt or use of the
            Services) for you to access and use the Services for your internal business or personal purposes.

            <br /><br /><span class="bold">5. Charges and Payment</span>

            <br /><br />5.1. Pricing. Certain Services are offered under different pricing plans, the limits and
            features. Your rights and obligations with respect to certain Services will be based in part on the pricing
            plan you choose.

            <br /><br />5.2. Payment Terms.

            <br /><br />5.2.1. You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment methods that
            you provide to us.

            <br /><br />5.2.2. In the event that you fail to pay the full amount owed to us, we may limit your access to
            the Services, in addition to any other rights or remedies we may have.

            <br /><br />5.3. Withholding. All payments made by you to us under these Terms exclude any deduction or
            withholding. If any such deduction or withholding (including but not limited to cross-border withholding
            taxes) is required by law, you will pay such additional amounts as are necessary so that the net amount
            received by us after such deduction or withholding will be equal to the full amount that we would have
            received if no deduction or withholding had been required. Each party will use commercially reasonable
            efforts to work with the other party to help obtain, reduce, or eliminate any necessary withholding,
            deduction, or royalty tax exemptions where applicable.

            <br /><br /><span class="bold">6. Confidentiality.</span>

            <br /><br />6.1. Confidential Information. We (the “Discloser”) have disclosed or may disclose proprietary
            or non-public business, technical, financial, or other information (“Confidential Information”) to you (the
            “Recipient”). Our Confidential Information expressly includes non-public information regarding features,
            functionality, and performance of the Services, including security related information.

            <br /><br />6.2. Obligations. The Recipient will use the Disclosers Confidential Information only for the
            purpose of evaluating whether or not to use (or continue to use) the Services. The Recipient will not
            disclose the Discloser’s Confidential Information to parties other than the Recipient’s employees,
            contractors, affiliates, agents, or professional advisors (“Representatives”) who need to know it and who
            have a legal obligation to keep it confidential. The Recipient will ensure that its Representatives are
            subject to no less restrictive confidentiality obligations than those herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
            the Recipient may disclose the Discloser’s Confidential Information: (a) if directed by Discloser; or (b) to
            the extent required by applicable legal process, provided that the Recipient uses commercially reasonable
            efforts to (i) promptly notify the Discloser in advance, to the extent permitted by law, and (ii) comply
            with the Discloser’s reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose the disclosure. The obligations set
            forth herein will survive for so long as these Terms are in effect between the parties and for five years
            thereafter.

            <br /><br /><span class="bold">7. Indemnity.</span>
            <br /><br /> You will indemnify and hold harmless Bunt and its officers, directors, employees, and agents,
            from and against any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, and costs and expenses,
            including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected
            with (i) your access to or use of the Services; (ii) your Customer Materials; (iii) your violation of these
            Terms, or (iv) your use of Community Resources.
            <br /><br /><span class="bold">8. Limitations of Liability.</span>

            <br /><br />8.1. NEITHER Bunt NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE
            SERVICES (“SUPPLIERS”) WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
            INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE, SYSTEM FAILURE, OR
            THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR
            INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT
            LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT Bunt HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
            DAMAGE.

            <br /><br />8.2. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF
            WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS OF THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS
            ALLOCATION IS REFLECTED IN THE PRICING OFFERED BY Bunt TO YOU AND IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF
            THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER
            PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED
            BY LAW AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THESE TERMS.
            <br /><br /><span class="bold">9. Termination.</span>

            <br /><br />9.1. We may terminate your access to and use of the Services, at our sole discretion, at any
            time and without notice or liability to you, provided that if Bunt freezes your order or cancels your order
            and the termination is not due to your breach of these Terms, Bunt will provide you a pro rata refund of
            pre-paid unused fees unless, in our reasonable estimation, we are not legally permitted to do so (in which
            case any refund rights are null and void).

            <br /><br />9.2. Upon any termination, discontinuation, or cancellation of print order, the following
            provisions of these Terms will survive: Service Terms, Charges and Payment (to the extent you owe any fees
            at the time of termination); Confidentiality; provisions related to permissions to access Customer Materials
            (to the extent applicable); Warranties and Disclaimers; Indemnity; Limitations of Liability; Termination;
            and the Miscellaneous provisions under Section 11. Furthermore, we may remove or delete your Customer
            Materials within a reasonable period of time after the termination or cancellation of Services or your Bunt
            order.
            <br /><br /><span class="bold">10. Miscellaneous.</span>

            <br /><br />10.1. Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy (www.Bunt.com/privacy) governs how we collect, use and
            disclose information from the Services.

            <br /><br />You and we both agree to resolve disputes related to your use of the Services or these Terms
            (each, a “Claim”) in binding arbitration instead of court, except that either party may bring suit in court
            to enjoin the infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.

            <br /><br />What is arbitration?

            <br /><br />Arbitration does not involve a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral person (the “arbitrator”) hears
            each party’s side of the dispute and makes a decision that is finally binding on both parties. The
            arbitrator can award the same relief as a court could, including monetary damages. While court review of an
            arbitration award is limited, if a party fails to comply with the arbitrator’s decision, then the other
            party can have the arbitration decision enforced by a court.

            <br /><br />Can a Claim be part of a class action or similar proceeding?

            <br /><br />NO. YOU AGREE TO RESOLVE YOUR CLAIMS WITH US SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS PART OF A
            CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION. WE AGREE TO DO THE SAME, WHETHER OR NOT YOU OPT OUT OF
            ARBITRATION. ACCORDINGLY, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE BOTH ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PURSUE
            OR HAVE A DISPUTE RESOLVED AS A PLAINTIFF OR MEMBER IN ANY CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION.

            <br /><br />What rules apply in the arbitration?

            <br /><br />The arbitration will be conducted under the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) Consumer
            Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”). The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling
            1-800-778-7879.

            <br /><br />How will the arbitration be conducted? How much does it cost?

            <br /><br />The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA or a comparable arbitration body in the event the
            AAA is unable to conduct the arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be
            governed by the AAA Rules.

            <br /><br />Unless the arbitrator finds your Claim frivolous, we’ll pay for all filing, administration and
            arbitrator fees if your Claim is for less than $10,000, and we won’t seek our attorneys’ fees and costs if
            we prevail in the arbitration.
